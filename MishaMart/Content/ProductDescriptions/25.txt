TAKE POWER BACK IN THE WAR MACHINE EVENT
Peace? In this world, there’s no such thing. Resources have dwindled and death is the only hand being dealt.

Welcome to the end of the world as we know it. This is the War Machine event. Here, you’ll need to conquer 3 modes and save humanity from total annihilation.

Gain back control of precious resources in Domination by holding a majority of the capture points. If your squad is still upright, fight and take charge of a single capture point as all hell rains down upon you in King of the Hill. And if you still haven’t tasted the dirt, take up arms on the rogue AOS AI who caused this mess and wipe out her relentless horde of robots.

A new player has entered the game, no-pat, and they’re definitely not friendly. Repeat. Not friendly.

Has your squad got what it takes to take power back from this new machine of war?
