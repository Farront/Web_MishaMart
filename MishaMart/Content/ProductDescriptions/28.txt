With this module you will unlock the full and unlimited support for "F1 22" (by Codemasters/Electronic Arts) in Sim Racing Telemetry.

To use this module you must own a copy of "F1 22" on a supported platform (PC, PS4/5, Xbox) and follow the integrated instructions to record data.

Note: this product is not made by, or affiliated with, the developer and/or owners of the game.

On game updates the communication protocol could change, in this case we'll publish an update in a few days. For any problem, please contact us .

To record data, both the computer running SRT and the PC/console running the game must be connected to the same network. The game and SRT can run on the same computer. SRT records only complete timed laps. Follow the integrated instructions (Help button in the Recording view) to configure the game and properly record telemetry data.
